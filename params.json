{"name":"The League of Extraordinary Packages","tagline":"","body":"The League of Extraordinary Packages has one driving mission, to track down and develop PHP packages of the highest quality possible, using modern tools, standards and practices to distribute, test and strengthen the code.\r\n\r\nMembers of The League follow the standards put forward by the [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/), follow the best practices detailed by [PHP The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com/) and distribute all code through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).\r\n\r\n## Packages\r\n\r\n* [geotools](https://github.com/php-loep/Geotools) - Geotools is a PHP geo-related library, built atop Geocoder and React libraries.\r\n* [oauth1-client (WIP)](https://github.com/php-loep/oauth1-client) - A client library for integrating with OAuth 1.0 providers.\r\n* [oauth2-client](https://github.com/php-loep/oauth2-client) - Make it stupidly simple to integrate your application with OAuth 2.0 identity providers.\r\n* [oauth2-server](https://github.com/php-loep/oauth2-server) - A standards compliant OAuth 2.0 authorization server and resource server.\r\n* [monga](https://github.com/php-loep/monga) - A simple and swift MongoDB abstraction layer.\r\n* [statsd](https://github.com/php-loep/statsd) - A library for working with StatsD in PHP.\r\n* [twitter (WIP)](https://github.com/php-loep/twitter) - A high quality Twitter API library, ported from [python-twitter](https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/).\r\n\r\n## Rules\r\n\r\nWe accept any packages into the group as long as they solve a valid problem, and follow the following rules:\r\n\r\n1. Use PSR-2, with `League\\` as the PSR-0 namespace.\r\n1. List on Packagist, with the `league\\` vendor namespace.\r\n1. Shove code in a `src/` folder.\r\n1. Write unit tests. Aim for at least 80% coverage for v1.0.\r\n1. DocBlock all the things.\r\n1. [SemVer](http://semver.org/) must be used to manage version numbers.\r\n1. An extensiive README.\r\n  * Installation. [Example](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/#composer)\r\n  * Usage. [Example](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog)\r\n  * Requirements\r\n  * Contribution instructions (link to a CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n  * Framework Integration (Service Providers for Silex and/or Laravel 4 at minimum)\r\n  * Author\r\n  * License ([MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) or [DBAD](http://www.dbad-license.org/))\r\n  * Acknowledgements\r\n1. Include Travis-CI widget in README.\r\n1. Include Packagist widgets. [Example](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog).\r\n1. List Phil Sturgeon and Alex Bilbie as a maintainer on Packagist, to avoid \"hit by a bus\" scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nThe League hangs out in [#php-loep](irc://freenode.net/php-loep) on [Freenode IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=php-loep), so hopefully there will be a member or a user who can help.\r\n\r\nIf nobody is on IRC to help you, or you don't know how IRC works, throw up an issue on GitHub. _Please do not email any of the League directly!_. There are multiple developers per project, so emailing directly is not only a bad idea for you, but its rude because we've asked you not to. Issues get answered as soon as possible. **League members are allowed holidays**.\r\n\r\nFinally, League members are not responsible for helping you integrate our packages with your favorite framework. You have three options for integration:\r\n\r\n1. Use your framework documentation or forums to find a simple integration method.\r\n2. Send a pull request to the package to add a Service Provider (Silex and Laravel 4 has these).\r\n3. Make (or find) a glue package, for example: \"cakephp-monga\" would be a simple package which lists \"monga\" as a dependency and wraps the API, or config, or whatever it needs to be CakePHP specific.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
