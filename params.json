{"name":"The League of Extraordinary Packages","tagline":"","body":"The League of Extraordinary Packages has one driving mission, to track down and develop PHP packages of the highest quality possible, using modern tools, standards and practices to distribute, test and strengthen the code.\r\n\r\nMembers of The League follow the standards put forward by the [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/) and follow the best practices detailed by [PHP The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com/).\r\n\r\n## Rules\r\n\r\nWe accept any packages into the group as long as they solve a valid problem, and follow the following rules:\r\n\r\n1. Use PSR-2, with `League\\` as the PSR-0 namespace.\r\n1. List on Packagust, with the `league\\` vendor namespace.\r\n1. Shove code in a `src/` folder.\r\n1. Write unit tests. Aim for at least 80% coverage for v1.0.\r\n1. DocBlock all the things.\r\n1. An extensiive README.\r\n  * Installation. [Example](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/#composer)\r\n  * Usage. [Example](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog)\r\n  * Requirements\r\n  * Contribution instructions (link to a CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n  * Frameworks Integration (Silex and/or Laravel 4 at minimum is nice, but contact a contributor if you can't be bothered)\r\n  * Author\r\n  * License (DBAD or MIT)\r\n  * Acknowledgements\r\n1. Include Travis-CI widget in README.\r\n1. Include Packagist widgets. [Example](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog).\r\n1. List Phil and Alex as a maintainer on Packagist, to avoid \"hit by a bus\" scenarios.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
