{"name":"The League of Extraordinary Packages","tagline":"","body":"The League of Extraordinary Packages has one driving mission, to track down and develop PHP packages of the highest quality possible, using modern tools, standards and practices to distribute, test and strengthen the code.\r\n\r\nMembers of The League follow the standards put forward by the [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org/), follow the best practices detailed by [PHP The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com/) and distribute all code through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).\r\n\r\n## Packages\r\n\r\n* [geotools](https://github.com/php-loep/Geotools) - Geotools is a PHP geo-related library, built atop Geocoder and React libraries.\r\n* [oauth1-client (WIP)](https://github.com/php-loep/oauth1-client) - A client library for integrating with OAuth 1.0 providers.\r\n* [oauth2-client](https://github.com/php-loep/oauth2-client) - Make it stupidly simple to integrate your application with OAuth 2.0 identity providers.\r\n* [oauth2-server](https://github.com/php-loep/oauth2-server) - A standards compliant OAuth 2.0 authorization server and resource server.\r\n* [monga](https://github.com/php-loep/monga) - A simple and swift MongoDB abstraction layer.\r\n* [statsd](https://github.com/php-loep/statsd) - A library for working with StatsD in PHP.\r\n* [twitter (WIP)](https://github.com/php-loep/twitter) - A high quality Twitter API library, ported from [python-twitter](https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/).\r\n\r\n## Rules\r\n\r\nWe accept any packages into the group as long as they solve a valid problem, and follow the following rules:\r\n\r\n1. Use PSR-2, with `League\\` as the PSR-0 namespace.\r\n1. List on Packagist, with the `league\\` vendor namespace.\r\n1. Shove code in a `src/` folder.\r\n1. Write unit tests. Aim for at least 80% coverage for v1.0.\r\n1. DocBlock all the things.\r\n1. An extensiive README.\r\n  * Installation. [Example](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/#composer)\r\n  * Usage. [Example](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog)\r\n  * Requirements\r\n  * Contribution instructions (link to a CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n  * Framework Integration (Service Providers for Silex and/or Laravel 4 at minimum)\r\n  * Author\r\n  * License ([MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) or [DBAD](http://www.dbad-license.org/))\r\n  * Acknowledgements\r\n1. Include Travis-CI widget in README.\r\n1. Include Packagist widgets. [Example](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog).\r\n1. List Phil Sturgeon and Alex Bilbie as a maintainer on Packagist, to avoid \"hit by a bus\" scenarios.\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nThe League hangs out in [#php-loep](irc://freenode.net/php-loep) on [Freenode IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=php-loep), so hopefully there will be a member or a user who can help.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
